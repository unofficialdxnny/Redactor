# Redactor
censor personal data such as faces in a photo or video

----

This programme uses OpenCV to process an image to blur out faces

## Image Input
<p allign="center">
<img src="img1.jpg">
</p>

## Image Output

<p allign="center">
<img src="blurred_image.jpg">
</p>

ps I think OpenCV thought the uncle on the bottom right was way to beutiful and couldnt disrespect him by blurring his face.
